Either:
Search algorithm is not 100% correct and infinite recursion occurs:
  - algo needs to record 'parallel' (retrace path back to source) routes when unwinding the stack? - test this
  - some routes can 'dead end' (no valid children: another base case?) without reaching the destination?
or
Search algorithm is correct and stack gets too big
